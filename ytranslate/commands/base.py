    This class is mainly a bridge between a set of commands and
    the 'argparse' module.  The latter manage sub-commands, but
    the automation of function calls isn't very straightforward.
    This wrapper is used to create a simple (and as clean as
    possible) distinction between sub-commands.

    To create a new command, you should inherit from this class.
    The '__init__' method can be redefined to add arguments to the
    parser (the 'parser' attribute).  The 'execute' method is
    also to be redefined.
